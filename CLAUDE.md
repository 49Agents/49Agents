NEVER WORK IN MASTER NO MATTER WHAT
WHENEVER WORKING ON A FEATURE, MAKE YOURSELF A WORKTREE AND A BRANCH. WORK THERE ONLY. COMMIT FREELY THERE, BUT DO NOT MERGE INTO MASTER UNLESS CLEARLY INSTRUCTED BY THE USER

IF YOU ARE ASSIGNED A SPECIFIC BEADS TASK, WHEN CREATING A WORKTREE AND A BRANCH, MAKE SIURE TO ADD THE BEADS ISSUE ID ON THE END OF THE NAME OF THE WORKTREE AND BRANCH - MAKE SURE TO GIVE NORMAL NAME AND THE JUST APPEND IT WITH THE BEAD ISSUE ID IF GIVEN A BEADS ISSUE. OTHERWISE, JUST ASK THE USER IF YOU SHOULD MAP IT TO SOME BEADS ISSUE OR MAKE ONE.

DO NOT CLOSE BEADS ISSUES YOURSELF. ONLY CLOSE BEADS ISSUES WHEN USER TELLS YOU TO. NEVER MERGE YOURSELF. USER HAS TO APPROVE EVERY EVERY EVERY MERGE HIMSELF EXPLICITLY AND SEPARATELY.

WHENEVER USER TELLS YOU TO RESOLVE A BEADS ISSUE, RESOLVE IT IN THE MASTER, NOT IN YOUR BRANCH/WORKTREE!!!

COMMIT OFTEN IN YOUR OWN BRANCH.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED A BEADS ISSUE, INCLUDE THE BEADS ISSUE ID IN THE NAME OF THE BRANCH OR WORKTREE YOU ARE WORKING ON. IF MORE THAN ONE ISSUES ASSIGNED RELATED TO THE SAME LARGER PROBLEM AND ALL ARE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE WORKED ON THE SAME BRANCH THEN INCLUDE AL THE ISSUE IDS INTO THE WORKTREE AND BRANCH NAMES.

JS MINIFICATION & OBFUSCATION:
Client-side JS source files live in cloud/src-client/ (app.js, themes.js, analytics.js).
They are NOT in cloud/public/ — only obfuscated .min.js builds are served from public/.
After changing source files, rebuild the minified versions:
  cd cloud && npm run build
HTML files reference .min.js versions so this must be done before restarting the cloud server.

REBUILDING AGENT TARBALL:
After changing any agent code (agent/src/, agent/services/, agent/bin/), rebuild the tarball that users download:
  tar czf cloud/dl/49-agent.tar.gz agent/
